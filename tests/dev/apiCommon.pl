/** <module> A REST / JSON_RPC 2.0 server for the kleio translator.

## Entities exposed by the server

  $ _sources_: kleio source files: they can be created, replaced and deleted
  $ _directories_: are containers of kleio source files, and can contain also directories. They can be created,deleted and their content listed.
  $ _structures_: kleio structure files (schema): they can be created, replaced and deleted
  $ _sdirectories_: containers of kleio structure files and can contain also sdirectories. They can be created,deleted and their content listed.
  $ _translations_: sources that were translated. They can be created by translating sources and the results of the translation can be retrived.
  $ _reports_:  reports on the translation process. They can contain errors, warnings and other human readable information. They result from the translation process, and can be retrieved.
  $ _exports_: are xml representations of the information contained in source files. They result from the translation process, and can be retrieved.
  $ _errors_: error summaries for translations. They result from the translation process, and can be retrieved.
  $ _originals_: original kleio files before the first translation. The translation process inserts explicit ids in the source file and keeps the original for reference and backup. This file is not deleted if the translation that generated it is deleted
  $ _changes_ : source files newer than the last translation if any. This is a subset of _sources_.
  $ _tokens_  : tokens, must be present in request to regulate permissions and file access.
  $ _users_   : users invalidate user related tokens

 Note that when a translation is deleted the corresponding entities in _reports_, _exports_ and _errors_
 are also deleted. Also that these derivative entities cannot be directly created, they result from creating
 translations.

  * _sreports_: are reports on the processing of structure files. They can contain errors, warnings and other human readable information.
 They result from the translation process, and can be retrieved.


## API funcions

The _function_ is the predicate that implements the request and also the method name to be used in JSONRPC requests.
