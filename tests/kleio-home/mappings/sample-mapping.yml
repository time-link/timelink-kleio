# Mapping connect the groups in the source oriented model
#  to entities in the person oriented model
# Mapping files contain a list of "group"  and "entity" elements
# Entities are used to create new classes in the person oriented model
# and are only necessary if a group contains information not present in the
# base Person Oriented Model
