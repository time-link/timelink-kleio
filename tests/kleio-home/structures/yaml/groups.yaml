        This file contains the definitions of the core groups
        used in the Kleio schemas.

        The groups are defined in a YAML list, each group
        being a dictionary with the following keys:

        - name: the name of the group
        - description: a description of the group
        - position: a list of elements that can be registred without specifying the
                    name of the element, for instance

                    group:
                        name: person
                        position: [id, name, sex]
                        guaranteed: [id, name, sex]

                    This means that the following is valid:

                        person$id001/João/M

        - guaranteed: a list of elements that must be present

        - idprefix: the prefix for the ids of the group
        - part: a list of others groups that can be contained in this groups.
        - source: the group that this groups extends. This group keeps the
                    value of the keys of the source group, except if overriden
