        This file contains the definitions of the core groups
        used in the Kleio schemas.

        The groups are defined in a YAML list, each group
        being a dictionary with the following keys:

        - name: the name of the group
        - description: a description of the group
        - position: a list of elements that can be registred without specifying the
                    name of the element, for instance

                    - group:
                        name: person
                        position: [id, name, sex]
                        guaranteed: [id, name, sex]

                    This means that the following is valid:

                        person$id001/JoÃ£o/M

        - guaranteed: a list of elements that must be present
        - also: a list of elements that can optionally be present
        - idprefix: the prefix for the ids of the group
        - contains: a list of others groups that can be contained in this group.
        - contains: same as "part": a list of groups that can be contained in this group
        - source: the group that this groups extends. This group keeps the
                    value of the parameters of the source group, except if overriden

        Main group to register historical sources.
        A historical sources contain the records of historical acts
        or events that happened in the past. They can also contain
        lists of people, objects, geoentities, abstractions, etc.

        Specific types of sources are defined by extending this group.

        Each source has a unique id, which is compulsory.
        The id shoud be unique across all sources in the project.
        To avoid conflicts it is recommended that the id is the same
        as the file name of the source, without the extension.

# Authority registers
- group:
    name: authority-register
    description: >
        An authority register is container for authority records.
        Authority records in Timelink are similar to authory records
        in library systems. They are used to register identification
        of real entities (people, objects, etc.) and to link them.

        Currently the only authority register defined is the
        "identifications" register, which is used to record the
        real entities (people or objects) that
        aggregate occurrences in the source.

        This is an "abstract" group, meaning that it is not
        intended to be used directly, but rather extended by
        other groups that define specific authority registers.
    also: [date, user, dbase]

        Used to trigger inference rules before the end of an act or event

        Inference rules, that infer relations such as kinship and attributes
        such as civil status are normally triggered by the end of an act such as
        a marriage, baptism, or burial.

        Some acts or events however contain a large number of items that are
        independent one from the other and do not need to be processed
        together.

        Household list (rÃ³is de confessados) are an example of this,
        where each item is independent from the others and inference rules
        apply to each household item independently.

        By adding an "end" group after each household item, the inference rules
        are triggered and context information is cleared, so that the next item
        can be processed independently.

        Example:
            end$end of household 3
    position: [obs]
    also: [id]
    idprefix: end

        Relation have a type (kinship, professional...) and a
        value (e.g. "father", "mother", "colleague", etc.).

        Some special relations are generated automatically by the parser,
        such as "identification" relations to register that two entities
        are the same (generated from "same_as" and "xsame_as" elements),
        and "function-in-act" relations to register the function of an
        entity in an act.

# Other groups
- group:
    name: group-element
    description: >
        A group whose name correspondes to the name
        of an element of the enclosig group. During import
        the value of the first element of the group
        is used as the value of the element in the enclosing group.

        For example, if the enclosing group is "burial"
        with an element "place_of_burial", one can use

        burial$1580-01-01/place_of_death=Canton/place_of_burial=Macao

              husband$John Smith
                ls$residence/Zhuhai
                ls$profession/merchant

        if in the sources the values of the elements appear later
        in the source, one can use the group-element as such:

        burial$1580-01-01
            n$Mary Smith
              husband$John Smith

            place_of_death$Canton
            place_of_burial$Macao
            masses$9

        with place_of_death, place_of_burial and masses being
        group-elements, which will be processed as elements
        of the enclosing group "burial".
