        ====================================
        Elements used in the Kleio schemas
        ====================================

        This file contain the basic elements used
        in the definition of Kleio schemas (aka structures).

        Using these elements, or specializing them,
        triggers specific behaviours in the processing
        of Kleio data files.

        When defining specific groups with specific
        elements it is important to define new elements
        by specializing the ones bellow, with the "source"
        parameter. This will allow better processing of
        database mappings.

        For instance,

        element:
            name: comment
            source: obs

        To process sources in other languages new elements
        should be defined using the ones bellow as source.

        For instance, in Portuguese

        element:
            name: dia
            source: day

# Basic data types. Usefull to define the type of data field in
#      the destination database.
- element:
    name: number
    description: 'Any number '
- element:
    name: string64
    description: '64 chars strings like those used in ids. Use for elements that contain
      ids of other entities. Use ""id"" for entity own id. '
- element:
    name: string256
    description: Longer strings, like names or short descriptions.
- element:
    name: text
    description: Long texts, like descriptions, summaries, etc.

- element:
    name: date
    type: string64
    description: |

        Also allows ranges like 2021-01-01:2021-01-31
        and relative dates like >2021-01-01
